## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Setting up
======================================================================================

library(readxl)

```{r}
install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

DATA <- read_excel("./FINAL.xlsx")
```


======================================================================================
- Note: some of the unnecessary features of the dataset were eliminated while creating the dataset. 
- This included eliminating a school district whose address was located in Wisconsin and eliminating other 
- categories found in the datasets including unemployment and other racial categories. 
- A lot of this will not be found in the R Code as it was done in the initial creation

```

### General

```{r }

```

### x variable - school borders
```{r}

                                    "Elementary School Name - Elementary Attendance Boundary", 
                                    "Total Square Miles for Elem. Area"), new = c("sdname",

               "income9", "income10")

df_tib <- setnames (df_tib, old = old_income, new = new_income)
```

### Border
```{r}
df_tib <- rename (df_tib, c("County Border? (0N/1Y)"="cntybrdr"))
```

### Density

## Determining change in district + creating column
======================================================================================

```{r}
df_tib%>%
#arranging by year
  arrange(yr)%>%
  
#grouping by school district
  group_by(sdname, sbound)%>%
```  
#creating a column and beginning the binary
mutate(sbound = 
  case_when(
    yr %% yr == 0,
    yr %/% yr == 1),
  TRUE,
  lead(yr, n = 1L, default = NA, order_by = sdname),
  lag(yr, n = 1L, default = NA, order_by = sdname)
  )
  
#robustness test
lm_robust()
```{r}
change_df <- df_tib%>%
  select(yr, sdname, sbound)%>%
  group_by(sdname)%>%
  summarise(change = max(sbound) - min(sbound))
  
```
